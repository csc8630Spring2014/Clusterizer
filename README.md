Cluterizer
==========

Given a graph: generate clusters

##TODO
Standardize input and output formats for graphs
Implement MST greedy heuristic
Use results of greedy heuristic as seed for a GA or annealing technique

Hack the above together in python and networkX to prove it works

re-write in java or go becuase python is problematically slow.
